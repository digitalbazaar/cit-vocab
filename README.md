# Concealed ID Token Vocabulary

This vocabulary is used to express privacy-protecting tokens that are
designed to be recognized by only the issuing authority, used once,
circulate in an ecosystem, and not be trackable (except for by the issuing
authority). These sorts of tokens are useful when the issuing authority
needs to identify an entity that is interacting in an ecosystem without
enabling the other actors in the ecosystem to track the entity. Use cases
where this is useful include: limiting the use of restricted materials and
medicines by companies and individuals, acquisition of hazardous materials,
privacy-protecting loyalty programs, and offline scenarios that need to use
these types of tokens.
